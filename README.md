# Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
This is a sample app to anyone new to BDD using cucumber. It has setup and hello world examples just to get started with BDD.

The repository will be updated with more in depth examples of BDD using cucumber

## Getting started
### VanilaJS
goto vanilaJS path and run below commands
1.  `npm install`
2.  `npm test`

You will see all the tests and scenarios passing. You can experiment with the functions by adding more scenarios.
### BDD with Angular8 and typescript     
goto angular8/killerapp
1. ` npm install `
2. ` ng e2e `
3. If your into issues like `No update-config.json found. Run 'webdriver-manager update' to download binaries.` then run this command
`node node_modules\protractor\bin\webdriver-manager update` and run step 2 again. (For linux `node node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager update`)
